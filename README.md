# polymathProcess
The polymathProcess is an open-source framework for teaching ourselves how to create a more sovereign society.

### Why is hu3 creating the polymathProcess?
Every person deserves an easy way to influence how institutions affect our lives. We appreciate everything our societies offer, but we can’t ignore that our current system has a tendency to negatively impact people and The Planet.

We created the polymathProcess so people can explore their creativity, learn from diverse perspectives, and add to hu3agency’s brand story — huStory. 

### What’s huStory?
huStory is a collaborative narrative that chronicles what people are learning and sharing to redesign society in our image. The story is told from multiple perspectives, but it's always filtered through our integrative field of study called planetaryPhysiology.

planetaryPhysiology uses the human body as the roadmap for designing a more decentralized society. Humans are the link between the environment that created us and the civilization we’re creating, so we’re writing a story where the answers to our challenges really do come from within.

In planetaryPhysiology, all of the human/planet relationships are expressed with analogies:

    DNA : you :: polymathProcess : The Planet

Your DNA carries the genetic instructions for creating and operating all of your bodily systems. You can think of the polymathProcess as The Planet’s genetic ‘table of contents’ that makes it easier for everyone to decide where they want to contribute to huStory.
