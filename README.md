# polymathProcess
The polymathProcess is a relationship protocol for people to teach each other how to create a more sovereign society.

## What is a relationship protocol? 
hu3 defines a relationship protocol as a system of resources that help people define how they relate to life. 

The polymathProcess is just one example of a relationship protocol. We hope others explore the concept in their own way.

## Why is hu3 creating a relationship protocol?
hu3 is creating a relationship protocol so everyone can redefine how institutions relate to us. Currently, humans empower major institutions to define how we relate to life. We appreciate everything our society offers, but we also acknowledge that institutions have a history of pursuing power and success at the expense of people and The Planet.

If humans have an internet protocol to improve our online experience, we should also have a real world protocol that aims to improve our overall life experience. We created the polymathProcess as a relationship protocol for people to explore their creativity, learn from diverse perspectives, and add to hu3.agency’s brand story. 

## What’s hu3’s brand story?
hu3’s brand story is an open-sourced record of what people are learning and sharing through the lense of planetaryPhysiology to redesign society in our image.

We created planetaryPhysiology as a branch of biomimicry that uses human physiology as inspiration for projects that contribute to creating a more meaningful relationship between the environment that created us and the polymath society we’re creating.

## Where does the polymathProcess fit into planetaryPhysiology?
In planetaryPhysiology, we express our conceptual relationships between the human body and The Planet (“hu”) as analogies. Here’s our analogy for the polymathProcess:

DNA  :  you ::  polymathProcess  :  hu
DNA is to you as the polymathProcess is to The Planet ("hu")

Your DNA carries the genetic instructions for creating and operating all of your bodily systems. For The Planet (“hu”), the polymathProcess is a flexible framework that allows us to define how we create and operate society.

## How can people use the polymathProcess?
The polymathProcess is meant to be a tool that any person or brand can use to learn about and share different resources that relate to hu3’s brand story. People and brands are free to focus on one or more sections to add their unique perspective to our shared narrative.

ourHome: Learning and sharing about The Planet.

myHome: Learning and sharing about health.

ourAwareness: Learning and sharing about focus.

myJourney: Learning and sharing about creativity.

ourJourney: Learning and sharing about collective intelligence.

ourConnection: Learning and sharing about storytelling.

myConnection : Learning and sharing about meaning.

Each of these descriptions are intentionally broad. We hope you notice that you’re already creating content that fits into at least one of these categories. The idea is that you see where your interests fit into the polymathProcess and keep doing what you’re doing.

We’ll keep sharing how hu3 contributes to these sections, but we really want you to make this your own. To contribute, all you have to do is use a pair of hashtags. (Ex. #polymathProcess #myHome)
