Caption:
What would happen if every person taught themselves whatever they wanted to learn? We're sharing quotes from "The Polymath" to remind ourselves that the greatest achievements in history have been made by people who didn't limit themselves.

Our institutions thrive off of human specialization, but unfortunately, that usually at the expense of people living the lives they want. Let's come up with a new model that allows humans to discover their polymath potential so we can redesign institutions to support our creative growth.
