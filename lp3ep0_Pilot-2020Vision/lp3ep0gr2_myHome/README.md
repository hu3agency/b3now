### What is a human, and what role to they play in this epicPlaylist (EP)?

* _Relate_ - Humans are based on their relationships with themselves (eachother, The Planet, and their cultures). Since humans are avatars of The Planet, the state of any relationship informs the reader about how The Planet is relating to itself.
* _Body_ - In huStory, the human body was designed after the ecological systems of The Planet. How every person treats their own body is a reflection of how The Planet chooses to treat itself.
* _Mind_ - Each human mind acts as a node in the mind of The Planet. The mental state of each human is a representation of the mental state of The Planet.
