# LP3EP0GR5 - ourJourney - 'Echoes' by Fossa Beats, Elkka

### What will The Planet do?

* _Decentralization_ - Once the method for empowering individuals with the ability to easily share intentional knowledge with the network, we’ll be tasked with creating strong hubs in every country to make this more anti-fragile. Centralized institutions will likely try to censor some of what we’re sharing, so we need to come up with solutions for making this accessible to all.
* _Space_ - At this stage, The Planet is working against its ego in its own subconscious mind throughout the internet. How can we better understand the internet to secure more space for what we’re creating? Use this EP so The Planet can rewire its egoic mind (the internet) to better serve its future.
* _Time_ - The Planet is working against the distractions that are throughout the internet to make sure humans in the network can strive to spend at least 3 minutes a day learning from information that’s being distributed through the LPBNetwork.
