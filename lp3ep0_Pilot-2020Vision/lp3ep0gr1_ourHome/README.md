# LP3EP0GR1 - ourHome - 'Posthuous Forgiveness' by Tame Impala

### What is The Planet, and how is it the main character in this epicPlaylist (EP)?
* _Ecology_ - Fungi is the focus of lp3ep0. The Planet thinks by sending data through our mycelial network, and information is processed/transmitted through plants, animals, and humans acting as The Planet's neurons.
* _Physiology_ - Humans will be seen as self-similar fractal sections of The Planet. In lp3ep0, we'll be exploring the human nervous system to better understand how The Planet communicates.
* _Culture_ - Again considering fractals, culture is a self-similar projection modeled after humans. Humans are the neurons of our global society. In lp3ep0, we'll be exploring communication through our culture and, again, relating it back to how The Planet communicated with fungi.
