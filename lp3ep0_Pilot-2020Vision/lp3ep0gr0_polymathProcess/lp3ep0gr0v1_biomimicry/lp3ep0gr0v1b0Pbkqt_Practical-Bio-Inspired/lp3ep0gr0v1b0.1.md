What will happen when we apply bio-inspired design to brands and subcultures? We're testing this out by learning from #regenerativeAgriculture to design our own brand. This is an open-source project, and welcome anyone who wants to help out. In our model, human minds represent the essential soil for our slice of the internet. We're making sure the soil is fertile by sharing book quotes and videos that teach the community exactly what we're learning as we go. #ourLongPlay_gr0v1: #polymathProcess #biomimicry<br>

Want to help us define the subcultures that will shape the future? Your perspective matters. Send us a DM if you want to get more involved.<br>
