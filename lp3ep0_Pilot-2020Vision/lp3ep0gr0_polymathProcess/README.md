# LP3EP0GR0 - polymathProcess - 'Power?' by Moses Sumney

### Autodidactism - How will lp3ep0 explore our curiosity?
Are secret societies real? A lot of people think they hold all of the power in the world. Since we're interested in creating subcultures that can collaborate to define The Planet's path, we'll be learning more about different secret societies so we can all apply what we want to create @ourOpenSociety - an alternative to secret societies where every person has the power to difine our future. 

### Biomimicry - How will lp3ep0 relate to nature?
We're trying to make invisible forces (secret societies) visible. The non-human secret soceity on The Planet is definitly fungi. We'll be relating the unseen players defining our global culture to the unseen myceliym that define all life on The Planet.

### Ego Development - How will lp3ep0 measure growth and success?
Based on 'The 9 Stages of Ego Development' 75-80% of adults are in the 'Conventional' stage. To help ourselves evolve into the 'Post-Conventional' stage, we'll be tracking our growth based on the quality and consistency of the content we share. Rather than basing our success on external validation (likes and followers), we'll be defining our growth based on how disciplined we can be about sharing valuable information.
