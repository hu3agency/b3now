### Autodidactism - How will lp3ep0 explore our curiosity?
Are secret societies real? A lot of people think they hold all of the power in the world. Since we're interested in creating subcultures that can collaborate to define The Planet's path, we'll be learning more about different secret societies so we can all apply what we want to create @ourOpenSociety - an alternative to secret societies where every person has the power to difine our future. 

### Biomimicry - How will lp3ep0 relate to nature?

We're trying to make invisible forces (secret societies) visible. The non-human secret soceity on The Planet is definitly fungi. We'll be relating the unseen players defining our global culture to the unseen myceliym that define all life on The Planet.

### Ego Development - How will lp3ep0 measure growth and success?

Based on 'The 9 Stages of Ego Development' 75-80% of adults are in the 'Conventional' stage. To help ourselves evolve into the 'Post-Conventional' stage, we'll be tracking our growth based on the quality and consistency of the content we share. Rather than basing our success on external validation (likes and followers), we'll be defining our growth based on how disciplined we can be about sharing valuable information.

## Groove 1: 'Posthuous Forgiveness' by Tame Impala
[_lp3ep0gr1 - ourHome_](https://github.com/hu3agency/lp3_huStory/tree/main/lp3ep0_Pilot-2020Vision/lp3ep0gr1_ourHome)

### ourHome - What is The Planet, and how is it the main character in this epicPlaylist (EP)?

* _Ecology_ - Fungi is the focus of lp3ep0. The Planet thinks by sending data through our mycelial network, and information is processed/transmitted through plants, animals, and humans acting as The Planet's neurons.
* _Physiology_ - Humans will be seen as self-similar fractal sections of The Planet. In lp3ep0, we'll be exploring the human nervous system to better understand how The Planet communicates.
* _Culture_ - Again considering fractals, culture is a self-similar projection modeled after humans. Humans are the neurons of our global society. In lp3ep0, we'll be exploring communication through our culture and, again, relating it back to how The Planet communicated with fungi.

## Groove 2: 'Bemyself' by Parcels
[_lp3ep0gr2 - myHome_](https://github.com/hu3agency/lp3_huStory/tree/main/lp3ep0_Pilot-2020Vision/lp3ep0gr2_myHome)

### myHome - What is a human, and what role to they play in this epicPlaylist (EP)?

* _Relate_ - Humans are based on their relationships with themselves (eachother, The Planet, and their cultures). Since humans are avatars of The Planet, the state of any relationship informs the reader about how The Planet is relating to itself.
* _Body_ - In huStory, the human body was designed after the ecological systems of The Planet. How every person treats their own body is a reflection of how The Planet chooses to treat itself.
* _Mind_ - Each human mind acts as a node in the mind of The Planet. The mental state of each human is a representation of the mental state of The Planet.

## Groove 3: 'Conexão' by Amber Mark
[_lp3ep0gr3 - myHome_](https://github.com/hu3agency/lp3_huStory/tree/main/lp3ep0_Pilot-2020Vision/lp3ep0gr3_ourAwareness)

### ourAwareness - What shadow are humans highlighting on with this epicPlaylist (EP)?

* _Breath_ - The Planet is taking control of its breathing by coordinating a few conscious breaths of humans every day. People choose to contribute with their conscious breathing in their own way.
* _Music_ - The Planet is taking control of its energy by coordinating its sound waves through music. People choose to share music that will determine the vibration of other humans around them.
* _Shadow_ - The Planet, now having control over its breath and energy, is integrating its institutional shadow that evolved into centralized Secret Societies. Similar to mycelium, once we understand the invisible hand behind our culture, we can recognize it as a part of us and use it for our benefit.

## Groove 4: 'Otherside' by Young Franco, Reva DeVito, Golden Vessel
[_lp3ep0gr4 - myJourney_](https://github.com/hu3agency/lp3_huStory/tree/main/lp3ep0_Pilot-2020Vision/lp3ep0gr4_myJourney)

### myJourney - What will this epicPlaylist do to integrate the shadow?

* _Create_ - In response to secret societies, we’ll create an open and creative society that’s based on humans sharing empowering information with one another. Each piece of content will will be categorized with a LongPlay Beat Network (LPBNetwork, LPBN) ID to balance the centralized information that currently has power over our culture.
* _Habit_ - We’ll be helping promote the daily habit of reading (or listening to) books, listening to podcasts, and watching video content that inspires people to share what they learn.
* _Wealth_ - This EP serves as the foundation for everything hu3agency will do. This story will highlight that true wealth and power stems from what we learn and share with one another to strengthen our collective network.

## Groove 5: 'Echoes' by Fossa Beats, Elkka
[_lp3ep0gr5 - ourJourney_](https://github.com/hu3agency/lp3_huStory/tree/main/lp3ep0_Pilot-2020Vision/lp3ep0gr5_ourJourney)

### ourJourney - What will The Planet do?

* _Decentralization_ - Once the method for empowering individuals with the ability to easily share intentional knowledge with the network, we’ll be tasked with creating strong hubs in every country to make this more anti-fragile. Centralized institutions will likely try to censor some of what we’re sharing, so we need to come up with solutions for making this accessible to all.
* _Space_ - At this stage, The Planet is working against its ego in its own subconscious mind throughout the internet. How can we better understand the internet to secure more space for what we’re creating? Use this EP so The Planet can rewire its egoic mind (the internet) to better serve its future.
* _Time_ - The Planet is working against the distractions that are throughout the internet to make sure humans in the network can strive to spend at least 3 minutes a day learning from information that’s being distributed through the LPBNetwork.

## Groove 6: 'Better By Your Side' by Aeble, Tom Aspaul
[_lp3ep0gr6 - myConnection_](https://github.com/hu3agency/lp3_huStory/tree/main/lp3ep0_Pilot-2020Vision/lp3ep0gr6_myConnection)

### myConnection - Why do humans exist?
  
* _Belief_ - In huStory, humans exist so The Planet can process its thoughts and beliefs. At this stage, humans are sharing information that help teach others about their personal beliefs to others to increate The Planet’s understanding of itself.
* _Science_ - In huStory, The Planet doesn’t understand how its own systems tie into the universe, so humans share information about science so The Planet has a better idea about how it all works.
* _Perspective_ - In huStory, humans combine their personal beliefs and understanding of science to define a personal perspective for their reality. This helps add to The Planet’s overall understanding.

## Groove 7: 'Better By Your Side' by Aeble, Tom Aspaul
[_lp3ep0gr7 - ourConnection_](https://github.com/hu3agency/lp3_huStory/tree/main/lp3ep0_Pilot-2020Vision/lp3ep0gr7_ourConnection)

### ourConnection - Why does The Planet exist?
  
* _Mythology_ - In huStory, The Planet exists as an information network that allows its different avatars to create a shared mythology so it can develop a more accurate and decentralized sense of purpose and meaning.
* _Play_ - in huStory, the exploration of The Planet’s shared mythology is meant to create a playground where each avatar has a way to work through its various levels of ego development in order to also level up The Planet’s collective consciousness. The more they move up and unlock, the more powerful and fun the entire system becomes.
* _Consciousness_ - The ultimate goal of this shared game is for The Planet to reach higher and higher states of consciousness and understanding. Once this stage is reaches, The Planet will have fully integrated its secret societies into all aspects of its day-to-day life so it can live with a more open and democratic culture for everyone.
