* ourHome - What is The Planet? How does The Planet act as the protagonist in this EpicPlaylist?
  * Ecology - The Planet is the main character. Mycelium is how The Planet thinks/sends information and trees are the nodes where information is processed and transmitted.
  * Physiology - Humans are a smaller fractal projections (avatars) of The Planet. Human nervous system was modeled after mycelium and neurons are modeled after trees.
  * Culture - Culture is a larger fractal projection of humans. Communication was modeled after the human nervous system, and humans act as the neurons/nodes.
* myHome - What is a human? How do humans relate to The Planet in huStory?
  * Relate - Humans are based on relationships. How they relate to The Planet, themselves, each other, and their cultures. Since humans are avatars of The Planet, the state of any relationship informs the reader about how The Planet is relating to itself.
  * Body - In huStory, the human body was designed after the ecological systems of The Planet. How every person treats their own body is a reflection of how The Planet chooses to treat itself.
  * Mind - Each human mind acts as a node in the mind of The Planet. The mental state of each human is a representation of the mental state of The Planet.
* ourAwareness - What is experience? What Institution are we focused on exploring? What aspect of our shadow are we bringing to our awareness for integration?
  * Breath - The Planet is taking control of its breathing by coordinating a few conscious breaths of humans every day. People choose to contribute with their conscious breathing in their own way.
  * Music - The Planet is taking control of its energy by coordinating its sound waves through music. People choose to share music that will determine the vibration of other humans around them.
  * Shadow - The Planet, now having control over its breath and energy, is integrating its institutional shadow that evolved into centralized (egoic) Secret Societies. Similar to mycelium, once we understand the invisible hand behind our culture, we can recognize it as a part of us and use it for our benefit.
* myJourney - What will you do?
  * Create - In response to secret societies, we’ll create an open and creative society that’s based on humans sharing empowering information with one another. Information will be categorized as LongPlay Beat Network (LPBNetwork) in an open way to work against the centralized information that currently controls our culture.
  * Habit - We’ll be helping promote the habit of reading (or listening) to books, listening to podcasts, watching video content and sharing impactful quotes and clips. These will serve as the basis of everything we do.
  * Wealth - hu3 will create the LPBN system in response to secret societies so people are able to explore and unlock their true wealth as a creative polymath. In this EP, hu3’s goal is to help people see that their true wealth and power comes from the information that they learn and share.
* ourJourney - What will The Planet do?
  * Decentralization - Once the method for empowering individuals with the ability to easily share intentional knowledge with the network, we’ll be tasked with creating strong hubs in every country to make this more anti-fragile. Centralized institutions will likely try to censor some of what we’re sharing, so we need to come up with solutions for making this accessible to all.
  * Space - At this stage, The Planet is working against its ego in its own subconscious mind throughout the internet. How can we better understand the internet to secure more space for what we’re creating? Use this EP so The Planet can rewire its egoic mind (the internet) to better serve its future.
  * Time - The Planet is working against the distractions that are throughout the internet to make sure humans in the network can strive to spend at least 3 minutes a day learning from information that’s being distributed through the LPBNetwork.
* myConnection - Why do humans exist?
  * Belief - In huStory, humans exist so The Planet can process its thoughts and beliefs. At this stage, humans are sharing information that help teach others about their personal beliefs to others to increate The Planet’s understanding of itself.
  * Science - In huStory, The Planet doesn’t understand how its own systems tie into the universe, so humans share information about science so The Planet has a better idea about how it all works.
  * Perspective - In huStory, humans combine their personal beliefs and understanding of science to define a personal perspective for their reality. This helps add to The Planet’s overall understanding.
* ourConnection - Why does The Planet exist?
  * Mythology - In huStory, The Planet exists as an information network that allows its different avatars to create a shared mythology so it can develop a more accurate and decentralized sense of purpose and meaning.
  * Play - in huStory, the exploration of The Planet’s shared mythology is meant to create a playground where each avatar has a way to work through its various levels of ego development in order to also level up The Planet’s collective consciousness. The more they move up and unlock, the more powerful and fun the entire system becomes.
  * Consciousness - The ultimate goal of this shared game is for The Planet to reach higher and higher states of consciousness and understanding. Once this stage is reaches, The Planet will have fully integrated its secret societies into all aspects of its day-to-day life so it can live with a more open and democratic culture for everyone.
