# LP3EP0GR3 - ourAwareness - 'Conex√£o' by Amber Mark


### What shadow are humans highlighting on with this epicPlaylist (EP)?

* _Breath_ - The Planet is taking control of its breathing by coordinating a few conscious breaths of humans every day. People choose to contribute with their conscious breathing in their own way.
* _Music_ - The Planet is taking control of its energy by coordinating its sound waves through music. People choose to share music that will determine the vibration of other humans around them.
* _Shadow_ - The Planet, now having control over its breath and energy, is integrating its institutional shadow that evolved into centralized Secret Societies. Similar to mycelium, once we understand the invisible hand behind our culture, we can recognize it as a part of us and use it for our benefit.
