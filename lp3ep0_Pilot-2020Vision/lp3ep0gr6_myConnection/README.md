### Why do humans exist?
  
* _Belief_ - In huStory, humans exist so The Planet can process its thoughts and beliefs. At this stage, humans are sharing information that help teach others about their personal beliefs to others to increate The Planet’s understanding of itself.
* _Science_ - In huStory, The Planet doesn’t understand how its own systems tie into the universe, so humans share information about science so The Planet has a better idea about how it all works.
* _Perspective_ - In huStory, humans combine their personal beliefs and understanding of science to define a personal perspective for their reality. This helps add to The Planet’s overall understanding.
